# String formatting
# Old Style String Formatting (% Operator)
# In Python there are many ways of formatting strings. In this section, we will cover some of them. 
# The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), 
# together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", 
# special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.number of digitsf".

# %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
# %d - Integers
# %f - Floating point numbers
# "%.number of digitsf" - Floating point numbers with fixed precision

# Strings only
first_name = 'Camilo'
last_name = 'Arango'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am %s %s. I teach %s' %(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of circle with a radius %d is %.2f.' %(radius, area) # 2 refers the 2 significant digits after the point

python_libraries = ['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']
formated_string = 'The following are python libraries:%s' % (python_libraries)
print(formated_string) # "The following are python libraries:['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']"

# New Style String Formatting (str.format)
# This formatting is introduced in Python version 3.

first_name = 'Camilo'
last_name = 'Arango'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am {} {}. I teach {}'.format(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)
a = 4

print('{} + {} = {}'.format(a, b, a + b))
print('{} - {} = {}'.format(a, b, a - b))

# String Interpolation / f-Strings (Python 3.6+)
# Another new string formatting is string interpolation, f-strings. Strings start with f and we can inject 
# the data in their corresponding positions.

# Accessing Characters in Strings by Index
# In programming counting starts from zero. Therefore the first letter of a string is at zero

#String methods
# capitalize(): Converts the first character of the string to capital letter
# count(): returns occurrences of substring in string, count(substring, start=.., end=..). The start is a starting

#index(): Returns the lowest index of a substring, additional arguments indicate starting and ending index
#  (default 0 and string length - 1). If the substring is not found it raises a valueError.

# rindex(): Returns the highest index of a substring, additional arguments
#  indicate starting and ending index (default 0 and string length - 1)

# isalnum(): Checks alphanumeric character
# isalpha(): Checks if all string elements are alphabet characters (a-z and A-Z)
# isdecimal(): Checks if all characters in a string are decimal (0-9)
# isdigit(): Checks if all characters in a string are numbers (0-9 and some other unicode characters for numbers)
# isnumeric(): Checks if all characters in a string are numbers or number related (just like isdigit(), just accepts more symbols, like Â½)

# isidentifier(): Checks for a valid identifier - it checks if a string is a valid variable name
